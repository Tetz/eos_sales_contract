# Eos Sales Contract

## Local setup

## Prerequisites:

### 1. Operating System
You need to use either Linux or MacOs to interact with the contract as the eosio software currently does not support the operating system Windows. It is possible to enable linux as a subsystem in Windows. 
However, the following guide is aimed at Linux and MacOs systems. 
If you are using Windows you can get started here (https://medium.com/@blockgenic/eosio-single-node-testnet-setup-on-windows-ae7a59900e69).

### 2. NPM
You need to have npm installed to work with this implementation.  
It is recommended to use a node version manager such as nvm  (https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install npm

### 3. Eosio, keosd and nodeos
Please follow the steps 1.1 - 1.7 of the tutorials from the developer portal of EOS and install eosio, keosd and nodeos. Link: https://developers.eos.io/eosio-home/docs/introduction
